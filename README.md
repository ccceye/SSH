# SSH
## SSH (SECURE SHELL)

https://www.ssh.com

SSH is a software package that enables secure system administration and file transfers over insecure networks. It is used in nearly every data center, in every larger enterprise.

### THE SSH PROTOCOL

The SSH protocol uses encryption to secure the connection between a client and a server. All user authentication, commands, output, and file transfers are encrypted to protect against attacks in the network.

### RUNNING & CONFIGURING SSH

This section contains links topics around using, configuring, and administering SSH.

Command line options
sshd - The SSH server on Unix/Linux
sshd_config - Server configuration file on Unix/Linux
ssh_config - Client configuration file on Unix/Linux
SSH port, and how it got that number

#### SSH COMMAND

USING THE LINUX CLIENT

Linux typically uses the OpenSSH client. The ssh command to log into a remote machine is very simple. To log in to a remote computer called sample.ssh.com, type the following command at a shell prompt:

`ssh sample.ssh.com`

If this is the first time you use ssh to connect to this remote machine, you will see a message like:
```
The authenticity of host 'sample.ssh.com' cannot be established.
DSA key fingerprint is 04:48:30:31:b0:f3:5a:9b:01:9d:b3:a7:38:e2:b1:0c.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```
Type yes to continue. This will add the server to your list of known hosts `(~/.ssh/known_hosts)` as seen in the following message:
```
Warning: Permanently added 'sample.ssh.com' (DSA) to the list of known hosts.
```
Each server has a host key, and the above question related to verifying and saving the host key, so that next time you connect to the server, it can verify that it actually is the same server.

Once the server connection has been established, the user is authenticated. Typically, it asks for a password. For some servers, you may be required to type in a one-time password generated by a special hardware token.

Once authentication has been accepted, you will be at the shell prompt for the remote machine.
